Welcome to the official GitHub page for the 9xCraft Minecraft Launcher, Thanks for stopping by, I appreciate it.

This launcher is basically a graphical extension to simple command line strings used to run older minecraft versions directly from the .jar files, very similar to Betacraft, which I heavily recommend you check out over at https://betacraft.uk/

The launcher itself is designed to run with Java 5 SE and above. 

To run a game of minecraft, you will need to provide
your own .jar files. You can add said jars to the "Versions" folder the 
launcher is in if you feel like doing so. Alternatively, you can select "File" --> "Open .jar"
in the top left corner of the window to direct to a Minecraft .jar client on your computer to
open it directly without the need to put it into the Versions folder.

You can find client jars on https://minecraft.wiki.

In case you're interested in creating a desktop shortcut to the launcher, there's an "icon.ico" file inside the natives folder for you to use.

A few more notes: Older Minecraft instances ARE NOT ABLE TO SAVE WORLDS when using Java 5 SE. This is fixed by using Java 6 SE or above. 

Another thing, every single version of the 9xCraft Launcher and its successor, 2kCraft Launcher, have been recompiled on February 18th to utilize an LWJGL-fork that runs on Microsoft™ Windows© 95 and above, it's called MiniJGL, you can check it out at https://github.com/Vulpovile/MiniJGL. This fixes absolute incompatibility with DOS-based Windows operating systems where previously it would get stuck on a white screen and throw a path error in the log console.

This launcher is the predecessor of the 2kCraft Launcher which you can find over at https://github.com/SeiiLaur/2kCraft-Launcher. Different to that model, this older series of versions only requires Java 5 SE to run instead of its successor, Java 6 SE.


▓░░░░░░░░░░▓░░*About*░░▓░░░░░░░░░░░▓

The previous GitHub page for 9xCraft Launcher was recently deleted and my Exivaliant account suspended. In case I get a hold of the account again, i'll definitely re-archive each version of 9xCraft on it again.

I DO NOT HAVE A DISCORD SERVER (anymore);

Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this launcher in no way endorses a belief in the occult.
